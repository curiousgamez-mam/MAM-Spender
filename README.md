**MAMAutoPoints** is a Windows Forms (.NET 8) automation tool for **MyAnonAMouse (MAM)** — a private e-learning tracker. It monitors your seed bonus points and automatically purchases upload credit and/or VIP membership when configurable thresholds are met. No browser or manual interaction required.

- **VIP Auto-Renewal** — Optionally purchases VIP membership when your remaining period drops to 83 days or less (unchecked by default)
- **Freeleech Wedge Support** — Optionally buy FL wedges (50,000 pts) before or instead of upload credit
- **Points/Min Tracking** — Displays last scan points total and estimates your points-per-minute earning rate across sessions
- **Customizable Schedule** — Runs every 15 minutes by default (configurable down to 3 minutes)
- **Persistent Settings** — Saves all configuration, cookie path, and cumulative totals across restarts
- **System Tray Integration** — Minimizes to tray with background execution

## Download

Grab the latest portable `.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Plungis/MAMAutoPoints/releases) — no installation or runtime needed.

---

## How It Works

1. The app authenticates using a **mam_id session cookie** tied to your IP address
2. Every N minutes (default: 15), it fetches your current seed bonus balance from the MAM API
3. If your balance is ≥ **60,100 points**, it purchases **100 GiB of upload credit** for **50,000 points** (leaving ≥ 10,100 in reserve)
4. If VIP renewal is enabled and your VIP has ≤ 83 days remaining, it renews first
5. If FL Wedge mode is enabled, it buys a Freeleech Wedge (50,000 pts) before or instead of upload GB
6. Results and points/min are logged and displayed in the UI
