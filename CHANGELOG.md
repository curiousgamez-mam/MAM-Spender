# Changelog

All notable changes to **MAMAutoPoints** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.4wfb] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- Settings persistence — slider tier was saved from a stale hidden combo index and always restored to `100 GB`; now saves the actual trackbar position
- CI actions bumped to Node 24-compatible releases (`actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-dotnet@v6`, `actions/upload-artifact@v7`)

### Added
- `Save Settings` button — manually writes all settings to the config file and confirms the saved path
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-exe-on-release.yml`) — builds a single-file self-contained EXE and attaches `MAM-Auto-Points.zip` to published releases
- `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep a Changelog format

## [2.4.3wfb] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Slider `Min Upload GB` with 7 selectable tiers:
  - `500 pts -> 1 GB`
  - `1,250 pts -> 2.5 GB`
  - `2,500 pts -> 5 GB`
  - `10,000 pts -> 20 GB`
  - `25,000 pts -> 50 GB`
  - `50,000 pts -> 100 GB`
  - `Variable -> All I can afford`

### Changed
- Replaced fixed 100 GiB purchase with tier-based purchase logic
- Variable tier buys `floor((min(points, 99999) - buffer) / 500)` GB (max 199 GB)
- Points cap of `99,999` enforced; buffer is always respected as reserve

## [2.4.2wfb] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- `GetSeedBonusAsync` now uses `?uid=` instead of `?id=` — API was returning wrong points due to incorrect parameter name

## [2.4.1wfb] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- Remaining points and points-spent display now calculated correctly after purchase (was showing 0 / full balance due to API returning stale data)

### Added
- Fork branding by wildfirebill
